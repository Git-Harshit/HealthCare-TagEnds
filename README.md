### About 

This is the Repository for our Health Care System application on Web.
It will be built (in fact, is under active construction now), with MERN stack.

### Contributing

Collaborators can directly begin contributing in the repository by cloning the repository in their system, and updating the repository contents. 

General steps to get contributing are:

1. Fork the Repository
2. Clone your forked repository
3. Add/change the files and contents that you feel go towards project updation
4. `git add .` the changes (needed in case of Git CLI)
5. `git commit` the changes
6. Pull changes from server and push your changes over them.
7. Open a Pull Request, briefly mentioning about the changes you've done.

That's it from your side. Then, wait for your changes to be reviewed and merged.

Moreover, The Project is open to accept any issues that get encountered in the output or in the program files. We appreciate any issues open here.

The Web Application is open-sourced! Feel free to refer the code, and in case of any queries, do mention the same.

###### Note: Currently, only limited collaborators are allowed to implement and work on the project, since the initial submission will go towards [Hack CBS 3.0](https://hackcbs.tech). The repository and project may be opened for all regarding further updations later.
